# REDD Carbon - Decentralized Carbon Credit Marketplace  

## 💡 Transforming Carbon Credit Trading with Blockchain  
REDD Carbon is a **decentralized marketplace** for carbon credits, enabling **peer-to-peer trading** with **complete transparency, security, and fraud-proof verification** on the Ethereum blockchain.  

This marks a **Proof of Concept** for our larger vision—a **global, trustless system** for carbon trading that eliminates reliance on intermediaries and makes carbon markets truly **efficient, transparent, and scalable**. 

The tech-stack used or leveraged for our project here are Tailwind, React.js, Typescript.js, ethers.js, MetaMask, Solidity, Ethereum, HardHat complying with the ERRC-20 rules.
